## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mirian97/car-reservation-system.git
   cd car-reservation-system
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**

   ```bash
   cd server
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**

   ```bash
   cd ../web
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:

   ```env
   # Se estiver rodando no Docker Compose, use:
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/car-reservation

   # Se estiver rodando localmente (sem Docker), use:
   # MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/car-reservation

   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
   PORT=3000
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# From the project root
cd server
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:

- MongoDB on port 27017
- NestJS API on port 3005

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

**Backend:**

```bash
cd server
pnpm run start:dev
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd web
pnpm start
```

**Database:**
Make sure MongoDB is running locally or update the `MONGODB_URI` in your environment variables.

### Accessing the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:4200
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3005
- **MongoDB**: localhost:27017
